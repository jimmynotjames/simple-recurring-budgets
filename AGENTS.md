# Agent instructions (Claude Code and compatible tools)

This repo is a native SwiftUI app (SwiftData + CloudKit). Before specifying, planning, or implementing:

## Build and test

This section is the canonical procedure for any agent tool (Cursor, Claude Code, Codex, OpenSpec, etc.). The Cursor rule `.cursor/rules/ios-build-test.mdc` and `openspec/config.yaml` reference this section; do not duplicate the procedure elsewhere.

### Four-step order after substantive Swift / Xcode changes

Run in this exact order from the repo root. Fix failures before advancing to the next step.

1. **`make format`** — auto-fix formatting with `swiftformat .`. No review needed; just re-stage the changes.
2. **`make lint-fix`** — auto-fix correctable lint issues with `swiftlint --fix`, then run `swiftlint lint --strict` as the gate. Resolve any remaining strict violations manually.
3. **`make build`** — bare `xcodebuild build` with no test runner. Catches compile errors in seconds using the same simulator destination and derived-data cache as step 4.
4. **`make test`** — full Swift Testing suite on one iPhone simulator. Only run once steps 1–3 pass cleanly.

Steps 1–3 are seconds-cheap and let you fix lint/compile errors before paying the simulator boot + full-suite cost.

### Single destination

The two `xcodebuild` steps (**`make build`** and **`make test`**) target **one** iPhone simulator. The destination is resolved by `scripts/_destination.sh` (shared by `scripts/build.sh` and `scripts/test.sh`), in priority order:

1. **`SIMULATOR_UDID`** env var — pins a specific booted device (fastest; set once per session or in your shell profile).
2. Any **already-booted** simulator whose name matches `SIMULATOR_NAME` (resolved by [`scripts/resolve_booted_sim_udid.py`](scripts/resolve_booted_sim_udid.py), with a short `simctl` timeout).
3. **`name=…,OS=latest`** fallback — `xcodebuild` may cold-boot a simulator (slowest).

`xcodebuild` is invoked with **`-destination-timeout 300`** so destination resolution does not hang indefinitely. Leave **Simulator.app** open with your device, or run `xcrun simctl boot <UDID>` once per session. Pin a device:

```bash
xcrun simctl list devices available   # copy a UDID
export SIMULATOR_UDID='…'             # optional: add to your shell profile
make build   # or make test
```

Override the device name if needed:

```bash
SIMULATOR_NAME='iPhone 17' make build
```

If `xcodebuild` cannot find the destination, run `xcrun simctl list devices available` and set `SIMULATOR_NAME` or `SIMULATOR_UDID`, or install the latest simulator runtime in Xcode.

### Latest iOS / iPadOS only

- Keep **`IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`** aligned with the product rule: latest major OS only; do **not** lower it without an explicit product decision (see `docs/main-prd.md` and `docs/tech-design-doc.md`).
- The app target is universal (iPhone + iPad). One iPhone simulator run compiles the same target; extra iPad simulators are unnecessary unless validating iPad-specific UI.
- Do **not** run tests on multiple simulators or multiple iOS versions unless the user explicitly asks.

### Scheme

The shared scheme is [`simple-recurring-budgets.xcscheme`](simple-recurring-budgets.xcodeproj/xcshareddata/xcschemes/simple-recurring-budgets.xcscheme). Use `-scheme simple-recurring-budgets` (as in `scripts/build.sh` and `scripts/test.sh`).

## Concurrency (Swift 6, default MainActor isolation)

This project uses Swift 6.0 with `SWIFT_APPROACHABLE_CONCURRENCY = YES` and `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor` (SE-0466). Top-level code is implicitly `@MainActor` — do **not** sprinkle `@MainActor` reflexively. The full rule (with codebase-specific examples) lives at [`.cursor/rules/swift-concurrency.mdc`](.cursor/rules/swift-concurrency.mdc); read it before non-trivial Swift edits. Non-Cursor agents (Claude Code, Codex, OpenSpec) should treat that file as canonical for this section.

Quick rules:

- Off-main work: prefer (1) `nonisolated` sync helpers, (2) `@concurrent` async on a `nonisolated` type, (3) a custom `actor`, (4) `Task.detached` only as a last resort with a justifying comment.
- `Task { ... }` inside MainActor-isolated code stays on main — that is intentional. Do not add `@MainActor in`.
- `ModelContext` is **not `Sendable`**. Pass it at the call site on the MainActor; for background SwiftData work use a `@ModelActor` and pass `PersistentIdentifier`s.
- New value types should be `Sendable` by construction. For cross-isolation seams, mark the protocol `Sendable` (see `AnalyticsClient`).
- `@unchecked Sendable`, `nonisolated(unsafe)`, and `@preconcurrency` require an inline `// concurrency:` justification.
- After any Swift edit, the four-step build/test procedure above is the gate. `make build` must pass clean; never silence a data-race or isolation error with an unsafe escape hatch.

For deeper concurrency design (actor architectures, TaskGroup, AsyncSequence, reentrancy, migration), agents that have access to it should also load the `swift-concurrency` skill.

## High-level docs

Skim and respect:

- `docs/main-prd.md` — product constraints and glossary (including Over/Under vs remaining for the current Budget Period).
- `docs/product-features-planning.md` — feature IDs (F-x.xx) and acceptance criteria.
- `docs/tech-design-doc.md` — architecture, persistence/sync, data model, i18n/a11y/testing expectations.

## Conflicts and planning

- If the planned direction contradicts those files, say so with a short **Conflict with docs** block (file, summary, resolution: update doc / change plan / intentional exception).
- In **planning-only** modes (no implementation yet), still perform doc checks; written plans should include **Doc alignment** or **Conflicts with docs** when the topic touches product, features, architecture, data model, or sync—and list which `docs/*.md` files will need updates afterward, or none.

## Doc maintenance

When work materially changes product rules, F-x.xx entries, architecture, schema, or global constraints, update the matching `docs/*.md` file(s) or add an explicit task to do so before treating the work complete.

## OpenSpec

OpenSpec CLI merges workflow context from `openspec/config.yaml` (doc checks, apply/verify/archive expectations). Do not rely on editing autogenerated opsx command templates; change behavior via `openspec/config.yaml` and this file.
